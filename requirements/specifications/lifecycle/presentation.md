# App Presentation
need to write this up...

## States

- fullscreen
- obscured
- offscreen
- scaled
- thumbnail
- splash

## Off-screen Video
If an app has the `xrn:firebolt:capability:offscreen:audio` or `video` capability then it can keep playing video/audio.

Need a transition interface, e.g. `PresentationManager.hide()` to allow app to tear down video.
