## 1. Overview

App developers need to know which audio and video formats can be successfully played on a Firebolt device and its attached display.

An audio format includes values such as the audio container, codec, codec level, and bit rate of the audio stream.

A video format may include values such as the video container, codec, HDR profile, and resolution of the video stream.

Further, apps may also need to know about the media format currently playing in the media pipeline.

An app may need to check IP video playback that it has initiated to see if Dolby Audio is in fact active (as opposed to just present in the encoded data) in order to display metadata or badges to the user. Apps may also be playing [user-cultivated media](./media-access.md), and therefore have no metadata about the format of the files.

A first-party app may need to check all [Media Pipelines](./media-pipeline.md) for media format characteristics to display a global badge.

Additionally, apps may need to know what is supported by the device, *before* initiating any media playback.

As a W3C-based platform, there is no standard API for detecting media formats or codecs that works in all cases, short of inspecting the bytes of the media in the app itself.

To solve this, Firebolt APIs will be created to detect the formats and codecs currently being decoded by the [Media Pipeline](./media-pipeline.md).  Firebolt APIs will also be created to query whether the device supports playing content of various formats.

### 1.1. User Stories

### 1.2. As an OTT App developer

I want to know what is supported by the device and it's active AV chain:

- I want to know if a video or audio format (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HEVC, etc.) will work if playback is attempted.
- I want to know if a format profile or level (HEVC Main 10, VP9 Profile 2, etc.) is supported.
- I want to know how many audio output channels (e.g. 7.1, 5.1) are available.
- I want to know what resolutions and frame rates are supported (e.g. 1080p60).

I want to know what kind of content I'm currently playing:

- I want to know which video or audio format the media I'm currently playing is sending to the decoder.
- I want to know which video or audio format profile or level the media I'm currently playing is being sent to the decoder.
- I want to know how many audio output channels (e.g. 7.1, 5.1) are currently being sent to the decoder.
- I want to know what resolution and frame rate is currently being sent to the decoder.

### 1.3. As a first-party App developer

I want to show an audio/videophile overlay with detailed information:

- I want to know all video or audio formats that are currently being sent to a decoder.
- I want to know all video or audio format profiles/levels currently being sent to a decoder.
- I want to know all audio output channel profiles (e.g. 7.1, 5.1) currently being sent to a decoder.

## 4. Device Media Support

Apps need to know what types of media support the device is capable of.

To facilitate this, the `Device` module will have a set of methods that return possible media capabilities supported by the current device configuration.

These values do not change without a settings change or a firmware update.

### 4.1. Video Format Supported

The `Device` module **MUST** have a `videoFormatSupported` API that returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the format specified is supported by the current device and its AV chain. This API **MUST** return `boolean`.

  profile: "main10",
  hdr: Media.HDRProfile.HDR10_PLUS
})

const hdr10plusWithVP9 = videoFormatSupported(Media.VideoCodec.VP9, {
  profile: "p2",
  hdr: Media.HDRProfile.HDR10_PLUS,
  resolution: [3840, 2160]
})
```

The `videoFormatSupported` API **MUST** have a required `codec` parameter with the type `Media.VideoCodec`.

The `videoFormatSupported` API **MUST** have an optional `info` parameter which **MUST** be an object with zero or more of the following properties:

| Property     | Type                   | Description |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| `container`  | `Media.VideoContainer` | The content container format |
| `hdr`        | `Media.HDRProfile`     | The HDR profile that support is being checked for |
| `level`      | `string`               | The codec level: <br>**hevc**: `4.1`, `4.2`, `5.0`, `5.1`<br>**vp9**:`3.0`, `3.1`, `4.0`, `4.1`, `5.0`, `5.1` |
| `profile`    | `string`               | The codec profile: <br>**hevc**: `main`, `high`, `main10`<br>**vp9**: `p0`, `p2` |
| `resolution` | `array`               | The resolution in width and height (e.g. `[1920, 1080]`) of the media content being requested |

> **NOTE**: A device supporting a particular HDR profile and resolution does not mean that the current display also supports that profile and resolution. See `Display.hdrProfilesSupported()` for more info on detecting display HDR support.

The `videoFormatSupported` API **MUST NOT** return `true` unless the format specified is supported with **all** of the properties specified in `options` *at the same time*.

Use of the `videoFormatSupported` API requires access to the `use` role of the `xrn:firebolt:capability:device:info` capability.

#### 4.1.1. Audio Format Supported

The `Device` module **MUST** have an `audioFormatSupported` API that returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the format specified is supported by the current device configuration and its AV chain. This API **MUST** return a `boolean`.

```javascript
const atmosWithAC4 = audioFormatSupported(Media.AudioCodec.AC4, {
  atmos: true
})

const atmosWithEAC3 = audioFormatSupported(Media.AudioCodec.EAC3, {
  atmos: true
})
```

The `audioFormatSupported` API **MUST** have a required `codec` parameter with the type `Media.AudioCodec`.

The `audioFormatSupported` API **MUST** have an optional `options` parameter which **MUST** be an object with zero or more of the following properties:

| Property       | Type                    | Description |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| `atmos`        | `boolean`               | Whether or not Dolby Atmos support for the given format is being requested |
| `channels`     | `int`                   | Required number of audio channels |
| `codecLevel`   | `string`                | The codec level |
| `codecProfile` | `string`                | The codec profile: <br>**aac**: `mp2lc`, `mp4he` |
| `container`    | `Media.Container`       | The container format type |
| `mode`         | `Media.AudioOutputMode` | Specify which mode should be used to evaluate the request. Defaults to the current audio mode if not specified. |
| `sampleRate`   | `number`                | The sample rate being requested, in kHz |

If the `options` parameter is provided, then the `audioFormatSupported` API **MUST NOT** return `true` unless the format specified is supported with **all** of the properties specified by `options` *all at the same time*.

Use of the `audioFormatSupported` API requires access to the `use` role of the `xrn:firebolt:capability:device:info` capability.

## 5. Display Properties

Apps need to know various aspects of the current (or built-in) display on a device.

These will be surfaced in a new `Display` module.

Access to these APIs is governed by the `xrn:firebolt:capability:display:info` capability.

### 5.1. Supported HDR Profiles

If no display is present, a value of `unknown` is returned.

### 5.5. Refresh Rate

The `Display` module **MUST** have a `refreshRate` method that returns an number value for the refresh rate that the display supports (in Hz).

If no display is present, a value of zero is returned.

### 6. Device Properties

Apps need to know various aspects of the device, including its media playing capabilities.

These will be surfaced in the `Device` module.

Access to these APIs is governed by the `xrn:firebolt:capability:device:info` capability.

### 6.1. Current Video Mode

The `Device` module **MUST** have a `videoMode` method that returns the current video modes used by the device.

This method **MUST** return a value from the `Media.VideoMode` enum.

If no display is present, a value of `unknown` is returned.

### 6.1. Video Modes Supported

The `Device` module **MUST** have a `videoModesSupported` method that returns an array of valid video modes that the device supports, regardless of any connected display.

This method **MUST** return an array with one or more values from the `Media.VideoMode` enum.

### 6.2 Video Resolution

### 5.6. Is Source Frame Rate Used

The `Device` module **MUST** have a boolean `isSourceFrameRateUsed` API.

This API **MUST** return `true` if the HDMI output frame rate is set to follow video source frame rate.

Otherwise, this API **MUST** return `false`.

## 6. Audio Output Properties
Apps need to know various aspects of the current (or built in) audio output system on a device.

These will be surfaced in a new `AudioOutput` module.

Access to these APIs is governed by the `xrn:firebolt:capability:audio-output:info` capability.

### 6.1. Mode

The `AudioOutput` module **MUST** include a `mode` string API that returns an `Media.AudioOutputMode` enum that is one of the following values:

- `auto`
- `mono`
- `none`

- `stereo`
- `surround`
- `unknown`

## 7. Media Info

The Firebolt `MediaInfo` module consists of APIs to get information about any media actively being decoded by the Media Pipeline or an active HDMI input.

### 7.1. MediaInfo for Current App

Apps need a way to query the media info for media currently being played by the app. All of the following methods take a single `pipeline` parameter, which identifies the Media Pipeline in the current app's scope that is being queried, e.g.:

```javascript
import { MediaInfo } from '@firebolt-js/sdk'

MediaInfo.videoFormat(1) // return the video codec in the current app's media pipeline 1
MediaInfo.videoFormat(2) // return the video codec in the current app's media pipeline 2
```

**TODO**: where do we map video tags to ids? need a spec for this? same spec, new spec?
JL: i linked to the Media Pipeline spec and merged it into this branch... we should review.

The `pipeline` parameter is required for the JSON-RPC request, however, the Firebolt SDK **SHOULD** provide a default value of `1` if it is not provided by the calling app.

For example, the following would query the video format for the app's pipeline `1` in JavaScript (which supports default values for parameters).

```javascript
MediaInfo.videoFormat()
```

#### 7.1.1. Video Format

The `MediaInfo` module **MUST** have a `videoFormat` API that returns an `object` with the video codec (e.g. `avc`, `vp9`, etc.) and resolution of the media currently in the media pipeline (either playing or paused).

The `videoFormat` result **MUST** have a `codec` property with one of the values from the `Media.VideoCodec` enum.

The `videoFormat` result **MUST** have an `hdr` array property with zero or more `Media.HDRProfile` values.

If a value is included in the `hdr` array then the media currently in the media pipeline **MUST** include the denoted HDR metadata in the decoded video.

The `videoFormat` result **MUST** have a `resolution` property with a `Media.Dimensions` value.

The `videoFormat` result **MAY** have a `codecProfile` string property that denotes the profile of the codec.

The `videoFormat` result **MAY** have a `codecLevel` string property that denotes the level of the codec.

The `videoFormat` API **MUST** be a Firebolt `property:readonly` API, and
have a corresponding `onVideoFormatChanged` notification.

Use of the `videoFormat` APIs require access to the `use` role of the
`xrn:firebolt:capability:media-info:video-format` capability.

#### 7.1.2. Audio Format

The `MediaInfo` module **MUST** have a `audioFormat` API that returns an `object` with the
audio codec, e.g., AAC, AC3, etc., and sample rate of the media currently in the
media pipeline (either playing or paused).

The `audioFormat` result **MUST** have a `codec` property with one of the values from the `Media.AudioCodec` enum.

The `audioFormat` result **MUST** have a `channels` integer property that denotes the number of audio channels.

The `audioFormat` result **MUST** have a `sampleRate` integer property that denotes the audio sample rate.

The `audioFormat` result **MAY** have a `codecProfile` string property that denotes the profile of the codec.

The `audioFormat` result **MAY** have a `codecLevel` string property that denotes the level of the codec.

The `audioFormat` API **MUST** be a Firebolt `property:readonly` API, and have a corresponding `onAudioFormatChanged` notification.

Use of the `audioFormat` APIs require access to the `use` role of the `xrn:firebolt:capability:media-info:audio-format` capability.

### 7.2. Global MediaInfo

First party apps need a way to query which media formats are currently being output to the [media pipeline](./media-pipeline.md), without caring about which pipeline.

#### 7.2.1. Active Video Formats
The `MediaInfo` module **MUST** have a `activeVideoFormats` API that returns an array of `objects` with the video codec, e.g., H.265, VP9, etc., of the media currently in each media pipeline (either playing or paused).

Each item in the `activeVideoFormats` result array **MUST** conform to the same requirements as the indivual results from the [`videoFormat` API](#611-video-format).

Additionally, the `MediaInfo` module **MUST** have an `onActiveVideoFormatsChanged` notifier that fires whenever any pipeline starts, stops, or changes its current video format.

Example:

```typescript
const ishevc:boolean = await MediaInfo.activeVideoFormats().find(f => f.codec === Media.VideoCodec.HEVC)

MediaInfo.activeVideoFormats((active) => {
  const hevc = active.find(f => f.codec === Media.VideoCodec.HEVC)
  console.log('HEVC codec is now ' + (hevc ? 'active' : 'inactive') + '.')
})
```

Access to these APIs is gated by `manage` access to the `xrn:firebolt:capability:media-info:video-format` capability.

#### 7.2.2. Active Audio Formats
The `MediaInfo` module **MUST** have a `activeAudioFormats` API that returns an `object` with the audio codec, e.g., AAC, AC3, etc., of the media currently in the media pipeline (either playing or paused).

Each item in the `activeAudioFormats` result array **MUST** conform to the same requirements as the indivual results from the [`audioFormat` API](#612-audio-format).

Additionally, the `MediaInfo` module **MUST** have an `onActiveAudioFormatsChanged` notifier that fires whenever any pipeline starts, stops, or changes its current audio format.

Example:

```typescript
const isaac:boolean = await MediaInfo.activeAudioFormats().find(f => f.codec === Media.AudioCodec.AAC)

MediaInfo.activeAudioFormats((active) => {
  const aac = active.find(f => f.codec === Media.AudioCodec.AAC)
  console.log('AAC codec is now ' + (aac ? 'active' : 'inactive') + '.')
})
```

Access to these APIs is gated by `manage` access to the `xrn:firebolt:capability:media-info:audio-format` capability.
